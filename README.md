# React Project

Welcome to the React project! This README file will guide you on how to run the project locally after downloading the folder from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following softwares installed on your local system:

- Node.js (version 10 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

To run the React project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project folder from GitHub.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
   or if you are using yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
4.Install the proper module for this react typescript by running the following command:
   ```
   npx create-react-app . --template typescript
   ```
5. Once the dependencies are installed successfully, start the development server by running the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
   or if you are using yarn:
    ```

6. Your default browser should automatically open and load the project at http://localhost:3000. If it doesn't, manually open your browser and go to that URL.
